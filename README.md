# Macro-Impact-EURUSD-Quantitative-Analysis
A comprehensive macroeconomic and technical analysis toolkit for the EUR/USD currency pair — featuring volatility modeling, Sharpe/Sortino ratios, Monte Carlo simulations, and multi-asset backtesting using Python.
EUR-USD-Macro-Analysis
A quantitative macroeconomic analytics project analyzing the EUR/USD exchange rate through the lens of U.S. macro indicators such as Treasury yields, interest rates, inflation, and the USD Index.

📈 EUR/USD Macro Analysis Toolkit
🚀 Description
This project investigates the behavior of the EUR/USD currency pair in relation to major U.S. macroeconomic variables, including:

10-Year Treasury Yield

Effective Federal Funds Rate (FFR)

Consumer Price Index (CPI)

U.S. Dollar Index (DXY)

The objective is to uncover patterns, correlations, and potential leading indicators that affect currency performance, risk, and volatility. This analysis helps understand macro-driven FX dynamics for traders, analysts, and economists.

The project covers:

Time-series alignment and preprocessing of daily financial and macroeconomic data (2006–2025)

Visualization of macro trends alongside EUR/USD behavior

Calculation of rolling volatility, log returns, drawdowns, and Sharpe ratios

Correlation analysis between macroeconomic variables and EUR/USD returns

Preparation for integration into more advanced forecasting or trading strategies

📊 Technologies Used
Python (Data analysis and visualization)

Pandas and NumPy (Data manipulation)

yFinance, FRED API (Data sourcing)

Matplotlib and Seaborn (Plotting and visualizations)

SciPy (Statistical analysis)

Jupyter Notebook (Interactive development environment)
