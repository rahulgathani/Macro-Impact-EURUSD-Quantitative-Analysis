ðŸ§  Project Title: Macro Impact FX Prediction EUR/USD with ML and SHAP

ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project explores the quantitative relationship between macroeconomic indicators and the EUR/USD exchange rate using explainable machine learning. It integrates data wrangling, technical and macroeconomic analysis, regime modeling, model interpretability, and scenario simulation into a complete FX forecasting framework. SHAP values are used to provide transparency into the modelâ€™s decision-making process.

âœ… What This Project Demonstrates
End-to-end FX and macro modeling workflow
Quantitative macro impact analysis on FX trends
Hands-on use of technical indicators and time-series features
Machine learning (Random Forest, Decision Tree) for classification
Regime detection using Gaussian HMMs
Model interpretability using SHAP
Feature drift detection using KS-test and JS divergence
Macro scenario shock simulation with SHAP delta analysis
Fully built in Python using free and open data

ðŸ§± Key Modules & Steps

ðŸ“¥ Data Collection
EUR/USD FX rate via yfinance
Macroeconomic indicators from FRED:
US 10-Year Treasury Yield (DGS10)
Federal Funds Rate (FEDFUNDS)
US CPI Inflation (CPIAUCSL)
US Dollar Index (DTWEXBGS)

ðŸ§¹ Data Wrangling
Date alignment and frequency normalization
Handling missing values
Calculating returns and percentage changes
Creating lag features for predictive modeling

ðŸ“Š Exploratory Analysis
Visualizations of EUR/USD alongside macro trends
Rolling correlation plots (EUR/USD vs CPI, DXY, etc.)
Rolling volatility using standard deviation

ðŸ“ˆ Strategy Backtesting
Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossover (50 vs 200)
Backtest comparison vs Buy & Hold
Sharpe ratio, drawdowns, and equity curve

ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Models
Random Forest and Decision Tree Classifiers
Features: RSI, MACD, SMA_diff, lagged returns, macro changes
Evaluation via accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix

ðŸ§  Macro Regime Detection
Gaussian Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to infer economic states
Regime labels integrated into FX modeling
Regime overlay visualization on FX trend

ðŸ§ª Drift Monitoring
Rolling SHAP value trends to detect feature impact drift
Statistical tests (KS-test, JS divergence) to detect distributional shifts in macro features and regimes

ðŸ”¬ Scenario Simulation & SHAP Analysis
Simulate macro shocks (e.g., CPI spike, Fed hike)
Recompute SHAP values and plot differential feature contributions
Measure and visualize model sensitivity to macro changes

ðŸ“Š Visualizations Used
Time series of EUR/USD
Overlaid macroeconomic indicators and FX
Correlation and volatility heatmaps
SHAP feature attribution plots
SHAP delta bar charts for scenario comparison
Regime sequence plots

ðŸ“¦ Python Libraries Used
pandas, numpy, yfinance, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, ta, shap, fredapi, xgboost, hmmlearn, scipy
